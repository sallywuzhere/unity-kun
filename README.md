# Unity-kun: An Open Source Shonen Avatar for Unity
The goal of this project is to offer a masculine alternative to <a href="https://unity-chan.com/">Unity-chan</a>, the wonderful mascot from Unity Japan.

Unity-kun is derived from a VRoid/VRM base, so has a typical skeleton compatible with VRoid animation sets.

Unity-kun has a full set of 52 Apple ARKit Blendshapes as well as the default VRoid Blendshapes.
  
  
## Installation
To use Unity-kun, launch Unity and import the UnityPackage using "Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...".
  
  
## Package Contents
The UnityPackage contains the following:

Unity-kun's materials introduce an MToon shader dependency, which is included from UniVRM, here: https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM
